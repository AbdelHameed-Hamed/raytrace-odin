# Building

First, you need to have a few things installed.

- [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/)
- [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/)

Next, you'll need to get the submodules via `git submodule init --update`.

Finally, you'll be able to build it via a simple `build.bat` invocation from cmd.

Note: This only runs on windows.
